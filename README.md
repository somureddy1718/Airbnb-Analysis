# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes Airbnb listings data to uncover insights into pricing, availability, neighborhood trends, and other key metrics. The analysis was conducted as part of an academic project and provides visual and statistical exploration of the dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb listing data to answer business-related questions such as:
- Which neighborhoods have the most listings?
- What factors influence the price of a listing?
- How does availability vary across neighborhoods?
- Are there patterns in review scores and pricing?

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling
- **GeoPandas / Folium** (if used) for geospatial analysis

- Key Findings

- Certain neighborhoods consistently showed higher prices and greater availability.
- There is a positive correlation between the number of reviews and the occupancy rate.
- Listings with higher review scores tend to have slightly higher prices, but location remains the dominant pricing factor.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

The project provides a comprehensive overview of Airbnb listing trends and can be used as a foundation for pricing models, host strategies, or market research.
